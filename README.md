# workdayscheduler.github.io

This is the creation of a day planner with an 8 hour work day from 9am to 5pm:

-The planner must be able to save entries to local storage

-At the end of each time slot a save button had to be created

-Added event listeners for the save buttons for the local storage

-The library of "moment.js" had to be used for the javascript to properly format the time slots

-Color coding of time slots relative to current time, had to update on its own

-Needs to compare each hour to current hour

-if/else statements created for time differences
